This is a consolidated, one-page, reference-style rendering of the lecture videos, notes and problem sets from Stanford's popular CS229 course.

It is an amalgamation of the following sources:

- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU - latest lecture videos
- https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229/47 - problem sets, solutions and data, without a paywall
- http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html - notes and additional resources

**NOTE: I do not own any of the material presented here. All these resources belong to and were made publicly available by Stanford University/Stanford Engineering Everywhere/Stanford Online. This is simply a consolidation of said resources for convenience that I have prepared for my own learning.**
